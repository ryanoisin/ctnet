Maintainer: Oisín Ryan <o.ryan@uu.nl>
Description: A package to help with continuous-time network analysis. 
  Estimation of CT-VAR(1) models should be conducted with ctsem or an alternative package. This package processes output from estimated models,
  and allows  researchers to a) obtain estimated path-specific effects and centrality measures b) quantify the uncertainty around those measures 
  in the form of confidence/credible intervals (depending on the procedure used to estimated the model with `ctsem`) c) to simulate press and pulse interventions based on the estimated model and d) plot point estimates and credible intervals for different metrics as a function of the time-interval.
